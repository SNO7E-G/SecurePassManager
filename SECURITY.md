# Security Policy & Architecture

Security is the primary focus of SecurePassManager. This document outlines our security policy, architecture, and the measures we've taken to protect your sensitive data.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities very seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps for responsible disclosure:

1. **Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly**
2. **Email the details to security@example.com** or use GitHub's Security Advisory feature
3. **Include detailed information** about the vulnerability and steps to reproduce
4. **Wait for confirmation** before disclosing publicly

We aim to acknowledge reports within 24 hours and will work to address confirmed vulnerabilities as quickly as possible.

## Security Architecture

SecurePassManager employs a multi-layered security approach designed to protect your passwords at every level.

### 1. Master Password Protection

The master password is the foundation of security for your vault. It is:

- Never stored anywhere on disk
- Not transmitted over the network
- Used to derive encryption keys through key derivation functions
- The only key required to unlock your vault

### 2. Key Derivation

We use industry-standard key derivation functions to transform your master password into encryption keys:

- **Argon2id** (default): Winner of the Password Hashing Competition, designed to be resistant to both GPU and ASIC attacks. Parameters are configurable:
  - Memory: Default 64MB (configurable up to 1GB)
  - Iterations: Default 3 (configurable up to 10)
  - Parallelism: Default 4 (configurable)

- **PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256** (fallback): Used when Argon2 is not available
  - Iterations: Default 310,000 (OWASP recommended minimum)

### 3. Encryption

All sensitive data is encrypted using authenticated encryption:

- **AES-256-GCM**: Industry standard authenticated encryption
- **XChaCha20-Poly1305**: Available as an alternative when libsodium is present
- **Authenticated Encryption**: All encryption includes authentication to prevent tampering
- **Individual Record Encryption**: Each password entry is individually encrypted

### 4. Secure Storage

Your encrypted vault is stored using secure practices:

- **Database Encryption**: The entire SQLite database is encrypted
- **Encrypted Fields**: Sensitive fields have an additional layer of encryption
- **No Plaintext Storage**: Password data is never stored in plaintext
- **Local Storage**: No cloud storage by default (optional secure sync available)

### 5. Memory Protection

We take extra steps to protect sensitive data in memory:

- **Memory Wiping**: Sensitive data is explicitly wiped from memory when no longer needed
- **Secure Memory Allocation**: When available, secure memory allocation is used
- **Anti-Forensic Techniques**: Multiple overwrite patterns used for secure deletion
- **Defense Against Cold Boot Attacks**: Minimizing time sensitive data stays in memory

### 6. Enhanced Security Module

The EnhancedSecurity class provides additional protection:

- **Password Breach Detection**: Checks against known breached password databases
- **Password Strength Analysis**: Advanced analysis with actionable recommendations
- **Secure Password Generation**: Cryptographically secure random password generation
- **Secure File Operations**: Secure encryption/decryption of files

## Cryptographic Standards

We adhere to modern cryptographic standards:

- **No Custom Cryptography**: We rely exclusively on well-tested, peer-reviewed cryptographic libraries
- **Key Algorithms**: AES-256-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305, Argon2id, PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256
- **Forward Secrecy**: Design allows changing the master password without re-encrypting all data
- **Quantum Resistance**: Larger key sizes and preparation for post-quantum algorithms

## Dependencies

Our critical security dependencies include:

- **OpenSSL**: For core cryptographic operations
- **Argon2**: For key derivation (when available)
- **SQLite**: For secure database operations
- **libsodium**: For additional cryptographic primitives (when available)

All dependencies are regularly audited and updated when security updates are available.

## Implementation Security Controls

The codebase incorporates several security controls:

- **Privilege Separation**: Different components have limited access to sensitive data
- **Input Validation**: All user input is validated before processing
- **Error Handling**: Secure error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information
- **Constant-Time Operations**: Critical comparison operations are constant-time to prevent timing attacks
- **Compiler Protections**: Built with stack protection, ASLR, and other compiler security features

## Code Review and Testing

Our security process includes:

- **Security-Focused Code Reviews**: All code changes undergo security review
- **Automated Testing**: Comprehensive test suite for cryptographic operations
- **Fuzzing**: Critical components are tested with input fuzzing
- **Static Analysis**: Regular static code analysis to identify potential vulnerabilities

## Data Handling Policies

We follow strict data handling practices:

- **Minimized Data Collection**: We only collect what's necessary
- **User Control**: Users have full control over their data
- **Transparency**: Clear documentation about all data practices
- **Secure Defaults**: Security is enabled by default, not an option

## Compliance

While primarily a security tool, SecurePassManager is designed with compliance in mind:

- **GDPR**: Respects data minimization and user control principles
- **CCPA**: Provides transparency and control over personal data
- **HIPAA**: Can be used as part of a compliant password management system
- **SOC2**: Follows security principles consistent with SOC2 requirements

## Security Roadmap

We are continuously improving our security measures:

- **Regular Security Audits**: Periodic independent security audits
- **Post-Quantum Cryptography**: Research and preparation for quantum-resistant algorithms
- **Hardware Security Module Integration**: Enhanced support for various HSMs
- **Advanced Threat Protection**: Enhanced protection against new threats

## Encryption Technical Details

For technical users, here are the specific cryptographic implementation details:

### AES-256-GCM Implementation
- **Key**: 256-bit derived from master password
- **IV/Nonce**: 12 bytes (96 bits) randomly generated for each encryption operation
- **Authentication Tag**: 16 bytes (128 bits) 
- **Additional Data**: The entry ID and type are used as additional authenticated data

### Argon2id Implementation
- **Salt**: 16 bytes (128 bits) randomly generated
- **Memory**: Default 65536 KiB (64 MiB)
- **Iterations**: Default 3 passes
- **Parallelism**: Default 4 lanes
- **Output**: 32 bytes (256 bits) key

### Password Storage
1. Master password → Argon2id → Master Key
2. Each entry encrypted using AES-256-GCM with unique IV
3. Authentication tag stored alongside ciphertext
4. Metadata stored in plaintext for efficient searching

## Secure Development Lifecycle

We follow a secure development lifecycle:

1. **Security Requirements**: Security requirements defined before development
2. **Threat Modeling**: Identifying potential threats during design
3. **Secure Implementation**: Following secure coding standards
4. **Security Testing**: Comprehensive testing before release
5. **Security Review**: Final security review before release
6. **Incident Response**: Prompt response to security incidents
