# Security Audit Reports

This document contains summaries of security audits performed on SecurePassManager. Regular security audits are conducted to ensure the application meets the highest security standards.

## Latest Audit - v1.2.0 (June 2023)

### Audit Information

- **Auditor**: Digital Security Partners, Inc.
- **Audit Period**: April 15 - May 30, 2023
- **Version Tested**: 1.2.0-rc2
- **Platform Coverage**: Windows 10/11, macOS 12, Ubuntu 22.04

### Summary

The security audit of SecurePassManager v1.2.0 found the application to provide robust security measures for protecting sensitive password data. The implementation of the Enhanced Security module significantly improved the overall security posture compared to previous versions.

### Key Findings

- **Cryptographic Implementation**: Correct implementation of AES-GCM and Argon2id with appropriate parameters.
- **Memory Handling**: Effective measures to protect sensitive data in memory, with minor improvements suggested.
- **Secure Development**: Evidence of secure coding practices throughout the codebase.

### Issues Identified

| ID | Severity | Title | Status |
|----|----------|-------|--------|
| SA-2023-01 | Medium | Potential timing side-channel in password comparison | Fixed in v1.2.0 |
| SA-2023-02 | Low | Clipboard data retained longer than necessary on certain platforms | Fixed in v1.2.0 |
| SA-2023-03 | Low | Incomplete memory wiping in rare error paths | Fixed in v1.2.0 |
| SA-2023-04 | Informational | Opportunities for more selective memory locking | Addressed in v1.2.0 |

### Recommendations

1. Consider additional countermeasures against cold boot attacks.
2. Implement quantum-resistant algorithms for future compatibility.
3. Add additional unit tests for error handling code paths.

## Previous Audit - v1.0.0 (December 2022)

### Audit Information

- **Auditor**: Secure Code Review, LLC
- **Audit Period**: November 1-30, 2022
- **Version Tested**: 1.0.0-beta3
- **Platform Coverage**: Windows 10, macOS 11, Ubuntu 20.04

### Summary

The initial security audit found SecurePassManager to provide good basic security for password storage, with room for improvement in several areas. Most identified issues were addressed before the final 1.0.0 release.

### Key Findings

- **Core Cryptography**: Appropriate selection of cryptographic algorithms.
- **Database Security**: Effective encryption of stored passwords.
- **Input Validation**: Generally robust handling of user input.

### Issues Identified

| ID | Severity | Title | Status |
|----|----------|-------|--------|
| SCR-2022-01 | High | Master password exposed in process memory longer than necessary | Fixed in v1.0.0 |
| SCR-2022-02 | Medium | PBKDF2 iteration count below recommended minimum | Fixed in v1.0.0 |
| SCR-2022-03 | Medium | Predictable IV generation in some encryption contexts | Fixed in v1.0.0 |
| SCR-2022-04 | Low | Insecure temporary file handling | Fixed in v1.0.0 |
| SCR-2022-05 | Low | Insufficient error handling could lead to information leakage | Fixed in v1.0.0 |

### Recommendations

1. Implement more secure memory handling (Addressed in v1.2.0).
2. Consider migration to Argon2 for key derivation (Implemented in v1.2.0).
3. Add protection against timing attacks (Implemented in v1.2.0).
4. Improve error messaging to avoid information leakage (Addressed in v1.1.0).

## Audit Methodology

Security audits of SecurePassManager typically include:

1. **Manual Code Review**: Examination of the codebase for security vulnerabilities.
2. **Automated Testing**: Static analysis, dynamic analysis, and fuzzing.
3. **Cryptographic Analysis**: Review of cryptographic implementations and protocols.
4. **Penetration Testing**: Attempts to compromise the application using various attack techniques.
5. **Configuration Review**: Assessment of build settings and deployment configurations.

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

SecurePassManager follows a responsible disclosure policy:

1. Security issues are prioritized based on severity.
2. Critical and high-severity issues are addressed immediately with emergency releases if necessary.
3. All identified security issues are documented and tracked until resolution.
4. Users are notified of security issues through release notes and security advisories when appropriate.

## Ongoing Security Assurance

1. **Continuous Integration**: Automated security testing as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
2. **Regular Audits**: Commitment to regular third-party security audits.
3. **Dependency Monitoring**: Tracking and updating dependencies to address known vulnerabilities.
4. **Security Training**: Ongoing security training for all developers contributing to the project.
