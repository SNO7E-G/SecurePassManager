# Threat Model

This document outlines the threat model considered during the design and implementation of SecurePassManager. Understanding potential threats and attack vectors is critical for ensuring robust security measures are in place.

## Assets to Protect

1. **Master Password**: The key that unlocks all other passwords.
2. **Stored Credentials**: Usernames, passwords, and other stored secrets.
3. **Metadata**: Information about websites, services, and usage patterns.
4. **Encryption Keys**: Derivation keys, database keys, and other cryptographic material.

## Threat Actors

1. **Malware/Spyware**: Software designed to compromise the system.
2. **Local Attackers**: Individuals with physical access to the device.
3. **Remote Attackers**: Malicious actors attempting to access data over a network.
4. **Service Providers**: Parties hosting services that might access password data.
5. **Insider Threats**: Individuals with privileged knowledge of the system's design or implementation.

## Attack Vectors

### Physical Access

1. **Device Theft**: Stolen computer or mobile device.
2. **Cold Boot Attacks**: Extracting encryption keys from memory after forced reboot.
3. **Hardware Keyloggers**: Physical devices that record keystrokes.
4. **Shoulder Surfing**: Visual observation of password entry.

### Software-Based Attacks

1. **Malware**: Keyloggers, screen capture tools, memory scrapers.
2. **Memory Dumps**: Extracting unencrypted secrets from process memory.
3. **Side-Channel Attacks**: Timing, power, or acoustic analysis to extract keys.
4. **Clipboard Monitoring**: Capturing passwords copied to the clipboard.

### Cryptographic Attacks

1. **Brute Force Attacks**: Exhaustive search of the password space.
2. **Dictionary Attacks**: Testing common passwords or word combinations.
3. **Rainbow Tables**: Using precomputed hash tables to crack password hashes.
4. **Quantum Computing Attacks**: Future threats from quantum computing algorithms.

### Implementation Attacks

1. **Buffer Overflows**: Exploiting memory management vulnerabilities.
2. **Format String Vulnerabilities**: Exploiting improper string handling.
3. **Integer Overflows**: Exploiting numeric calculation errors.
4. **Race Conditions**: Exploiting timing windows in concurrent operations.

### Social Engineering

1. **Phishing**: Deceptive attempts to obtain master passwords.
2. **Coercion**: Physical threats or legal compulsion to reveal passwords.

## Assumptions and Trust Boundaries

### System Assumptions

1. The operating system is not compromised before SecurePassManager installation.
2. The CPU and cryptographic hardware functions operate correctly.
3. The random number generator provides sufficient entropy.
4. The cryptographic implementations are correct and free from backdoors.

### Trust Boundaries

1. **Trusted**: The core SecurePassManager application code.
2. **Semi-Trusted**: The operating system and hardware platform.
3. **Untrusted**: Network connections, other applications, cloud storage.

## Mitigations

### Against Physical Access

1. Auto-lock functionality with configurable timeout.
2. Memory protection against cold boot attacks.
3. Use of secure entry mechanisms to resist keyloggers.

### Against Software Attacks

1. Secure memory handling with explicit wiping.
2. Protection against debugging and memory inspection.
3. Clipboard clearing after configurable timeout.
4. Process isolation where supported by the platform.

### Against Cryptographic Attacks

1. Use of Argon2id with high memory and computation requirements.
2. Large random salts for key derivation functions.
3. Multiple encryption layers with different keys.
4. Encryption algorithm diversity for protection against algorithm-specific weaknesses.

### Against Implementation Attacks

1. Input validation and sanitization.
2. Use of memory-safe programming practices.
3. Security-focused code reviews and testing.
4. Regular security updates.

### Against Social Engineering

1. Education about phishing techniques.
2. Optional duress passwords that reveal decoy content.
3. Minimal visible metadata in the user interface.

## Risk Evaluation

| Threat | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigations |
|--------|------------|--------|-------------|
| Malware | High | Critical | Memory protection, secure input, auto-locking |
| Brute Force | Medium | Critical | Argon2id, key stretching, rate limiting |
| Physical Theft | Medium | High | Encryption, auto-lock, secure storage |
| Memory Attacks | Medium | High | Secure memory handling, memory locking |
| Side-Channel | Low | Medium | Constant-time operations, implementation hardening |
| Implementation Flaws | Low | Critical | Code reviews, testing, updates |

## Response Plan

1. **Security Updates**: Regular updates to address emerging threats.
2. **Vulnerability Reporting**: Established process for reporting and addressing security issues.
3. **Breach Response**: Plans for notifying users and mitigating damage in case of compromise.
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Regular reviews and updates to this threat model based on new information.
